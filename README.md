# Network-Security-Assignment
This assignment design and implemented of an enterprise network security architecture using Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls across multisite environments, Singapore and Malaysia. It focuses on applying Palo Alto’s core capabilities such as zone-based segmentation, App-ID, User-ID, SSL decryption, and security policies to control traffic between departments while enforcing least privilege. 
Advanced features including GlobalProtect VPN, WildFire malware analysis, Anti-Virus, Anti-Spyware, DNS sinkholing, DDoS protection, and High Availability are configured and tested to secure both internal and remote access. The assignment also validates business requirements through hands-on testing, demonstrating how Palo Alto firewalls provide centralized visibility, granular application control, and strong protection against modern network threats
